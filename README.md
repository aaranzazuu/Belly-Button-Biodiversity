# Belly Button Biodiversity
This project is part of the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp at University of Oregon.

<b>Project Intro/Objective -</b><p>

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive dashboard to explore the belly button biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.<p>

<b>Methods Used - </b>
<ul>
<li>Data Visualization</li>
<li>Plotly</li>
<li>Json</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>D3</li>
</ul>

<b>Project Description -<b><p>

The interactive dashboard was created using D3 library to analyze a json file with data on microbes found in human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.<p>
